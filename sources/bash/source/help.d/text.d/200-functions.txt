FUNCTIONS

 catalog [NUMBER] -- DIRECTORY [...]
 
   Lists the files in DIRECTOR(IES). If NUMBER is supplied, it limits the
   maximum depth of the search; where 1 means do not traverse any children of
   the DIRECTORY; 2 is children of child DIRECTORY, so on and so forth.

 command [OPTIONS]        Runs the system command with the given options.
 
 directories FILE ...     Lists only the directories in FILE(S).
 files FILE ...           Lists only the file(s) in FILE(S).

 filter [-e] -- MATCH-PATTERN ...

  Searches through stdin line records seeking MATCH-PATTERN(S). If MATCH-PATTERN
  is found it is written to stdout unless the -e option has been specified. If
  the -e option has been specified, all matches are excluded from output.

 names FILE ...           Lists only the name parts of FILE(S).
 parents FILE ...         Lists only the parent-directories of FILE(S).

 links [-e] -- FILE ...   Lists only the links in FILE(S). With \`-e', lists
                          all files which are NOT links.

 mask-match  Reads records from stdin, masking all special matching characters.
             The result of this operation creates a plain-text-source-match-
             expression.

 read-parameter-pipe  COMMAND or FUNCTION [OPTIONS]

   Read lines from input and send them as parameters to COMMAND or FUNCTION
   with any OPTIONS.

 write-parameter-pipe  ...  Converts all parameters to line-stream-output.

 trace SOMETHING     Performs a debug trace explaining dependency chain,
                     backwards AND forwards [quantum-filters ;)].
                     
 realpaths FILE ...  List only the realpath(s) of FILE(S).

 key-within-list KEY -- VALUE ...

   Searches through VALUE(S) for KEY. Returns success if literally found. Ready
   made for read-parameter-pipe FUNCTION.

 line-count Performs line counting on stdin.

 set-case TYPE  Reads records from input and modifies the case according to
                TYPE. Where type is one of: flipped, upper or lower.

 subset CUT-PATTERN PASTE-TEXT[ CUT-PATTERN PASTE-TEXT[ ...]]

   Searches through stdin line records using CUT-PATTERN and replaces matches
   with PASTE-TEXT. Multiple CUT-PATTERN and PASTE-TEXT expressions may be
   supplied. Use the write-parameter-pipe FUNCTION if stdio is not convenient.
