COMMAND SHORTCUTS

 -i: FILTER   Perform an include match against FILTER(s). Works like \`-e:'.

 -s: TYPE     Perform a sort by TYPE; where TYPE is:

               u for uniqe sort.
               v for version sort.
               n for name sort.
               
               [TYPES cannot be combined as a single parameter to \`-s:']

 -e: FILTER   Perform an exclude match against FILTER(s). Multiple filters may
              be supplied as a single parameter. The shell will expand the
              FILTERS according to IFS (see also OPTIONS: \`-z': and \`-z') for
              control of the shell expansion.
